      <article>
        After growing up outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota, I attended the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> where I majored in psychology and developed an affinity for public service. While at the <a
          href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/">Perelman School of Medicine</a>, I’ve
        coupled this affinity with my interest in healthcare innovation to work on projects that improve the way the electronic health record helps clinicians care for under-resourced patients. Though I still identify primarily as a medical student,
        I
        am taking a year out of my studies to
        learn about the clinical informatics realm by working within the <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/clinical-informatics">Office of the CMIO</a> at Penn Medicine. In this role, I also conduct research through the
        <a href="https://www.nudgeunit.upenn.edu">Penn Medicine Nudge Unit</a>, the world's first behavioral design team embedded within a health system.
        <hr>
        Prior to entering medical school, I intended to train as a professional cellist and still play with the <a href="https://pennmedsymphony.com">Penn Med Symphony Orchestra</a> as well as my string quartet with my spare time. I additionally
        enjoy <a href="https://www.flickr.com/allisonhare/">digital photography</a> and have received several blue ribbons at the <a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/">Minnesota State Fair</a> for my work. Otherwise, I enjoy freelance writing,
        long-distance running, reading, and hot yoga.
